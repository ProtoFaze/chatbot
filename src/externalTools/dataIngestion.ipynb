      "# QUESTION & ANSWER\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Q. Can the Assured Member/spouse/children apply to contribute more?\n",

      "Q. Will the Company pay the full Death Benefit if the Assured Member commits suicide?\n",

      "\n",
      "Q. Can the dependent enjoy a higher sum assured compared to the Assured Member?\n",
      "A. No. The dependent's sum assured should be equal or less than the Assured Member's sum assured.\n",

      "2. In accordance with Paragraph 10 (2), Schedule 8 of the Financial Services Act 2013, the co-ordinator of the Scheme will receive 2% from the total premium as a service fee.\n",
      "3. Purchasing an investment-linked insurance plan is a long-term commitment. Early cancellation of the policy may result in high cost, the redemption value also depends on the current market value of the underlying asset in the fund. Thus the redemption value may be lesser than the total premium paid. This is an insurance product that is tied to the performance of the underlying assets, and is not a pure investment product such as unit trusts.\n",
      "4. You are also advised to read and understand the Sales Illustration, Product Disclosure Sheet and Fund Fact Sheet which may be obtained from your respective master policy holder/ agent for better understanding about this scheme. Should you require additional information about investment-linked insurance and medical and health insurance, please refer to the relevant insuranceinfo booklet available at www.insuranceinfo.com.my\n",
      "5. Pursuant to Paragraph 2, Schedule 8 of the Financial Services Act 2013, a Life Assured shall have fifteen (15) days from the date of receipt of the Certificate of Assurance to examine the terms and conditions. Life Assured may terminate the policy within the fifteen (15) days free-look period. If the Certificate of Assurance is terminated during this period, the Company shall refund an amount equaled to the sum of (a) total investment values of the assurance based on the net asset value (NAV) at the valuation date; and (b) the investment values of the units which have been cancelled to pay for insurance charges and policy fees based on the net asset value (NAV) at the next valuation date; and (c) the amount of premiums that have not been allocated to purchase units; minus the expenses incurred for medical examination, if any.\n",
      "6. The Company reserves the right to vary the rates in the Schedules of Benefits and/or the Premium Rates and/or the terms and provisions of this Policy (including the General Conditions and the Special Provisions) from time to time as it may deem fit, upon giving the Policyholder three (3) months' advance notice in writing of its intention to do so.\n",
      "7. The brochure is for general information only. It is not a contract of insurance. The exclusions and limitations of benefits highlighted above may not be exhaustive. For further information, reference shall be made to the terms and conditions specified in the policy issued by Great Eastern Life Assurance (Malaysia) Berhad.\n",
      "8. You should satisfy yourself that this plan will best serve your needs and that the premium payable under the policy is an amount you can afford.\n",
      "9. The insurance charges are not guaranteed and may be revised from time to time. Upward revision of insurance charges, if any, will be done on your policy anniversary and we will notify you in writing at least three (3) months before the revision takes place. The Company reserves the right to revise the benefit structure and restrictions/limitations for the Hospitalisation Benefit Rider on policy anniversary or upon renewal by giving at least thirty (30) days' notice.\n",
      "10. Risk charge on the 1st inception year will be based on the project data sheet that is being provided by the Master Policy Holder to the Company, and The Company will revise the risk charge after 1st year of scheme anniversary.\n",

This separation of links into layers allows for efficient and scalable routing in the graph. The construction algorithm starts from the top layer, which contains the longest links, and greedily traverses through the elements until a local minimum is reached. Then, the search switches to the lower layer with shorter links, and the process repeats. By keeping the maximum number of connections per element constant in all layers, the routing complexity in the graph scales logarithmically. This logarithmic complexity is achieved by assigning an integer level to each element, determining the maximum layer it belongs to. The construction algorithm incrementally builds a proximity graph for each layer, consisting of \"short\" links that approximate the Delaunay graph. Overall, logarithmic complexity in graph construction enables efficient and robust approximate nearest neighbor search.'\n",
